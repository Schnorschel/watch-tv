// ****************
// https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-a-sass-stylesheet/ <this link is better than the previous one
// **renamed Primary.sass back to index.sass and corrected file naming convention issues.
// SASS files, unlike CSS files, are often used in best practice to better sort/compartmentalize style pages
// for structure, just like how components and pages do for JSX.
// Readable code is the clear advantage and not stepping on each other's toes as the project scales.
// I see there are separate JSX components for the footer, page selector etc. and it makes much more sense to
// style these in their own SASS files and then link them back to the Primary.SASS file.

// ******
// Success on compile, see slack for update details if you wish.

// Here is the link for our main 5 colors in theme: https://coolors.co/1f3325-537c59-dde8dc-606060-60504e
// You are able to unlock any color and page through to see what looks good together if you wish.
// You could use other colors for accents, maybe some kind of yellow or what you like, but let's try to be
// consistent.
// I apologize for the color naming conventions here, I was not able to see auto-population of colors until
// creating an import only sass file this morning.
