// I renamed because we could potentially
// use better file structure for our SASS styling. our .sass file to Primary.sass It would appear that SASS
// files, unlike CSS files, are often used in a best practice way to better
// sort/compartmentalize style pages for structure, just like how components
// and pages do for JSX. Jason mentioned the browser will still compile
// multiple SASS files in his presentation today, so it's an advantage for
// readable code.
// I see there are separate JSX components for the footer, page selector etc.
// and it makes so much more sense to style these in their own SASS files and
// then link them back to the Primary.SASS here. I will experiment with this
// concept very briefly either tomorrow (Thanksgiving) or Friday early in a
// separate project and advise the outcome in our slack channel.

// Here is the link for our main 5 colors in theme:
// https://coolors.co/1f3325-537c59-dde8dc-606060-60504e
// I renamed the colors in this file to what makes sense, as the squares that
// indicate color did not auto-populate

// html
//   height: 100%
//   font: 16px / 1 sans-serif

// body
//   margin: 0
//   min-height: 100%

// There is no need for an export statement as this main file is referenced in index.js
