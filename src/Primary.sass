@import './TVShowPage.sass'

// This file is imported into index.js
// Import-only statement code like the one above is written here
// Success on compile!

// Naming conventions and notes so we know what's going on. I picked that up yesterday.

// Add this code to top of any .sass file you may want to make:
// Also you can grab the font import statement and color code for theme consistency from the top of TVShowPage.sass and place it above on your new .sass file so our colors/fonts are similar.

// html
//   height: 100%
//   font: 16px / 1 sans-serif

// body
//   margin: 0
//   min-height: 100%

// There is no need for an export statement as this main file is referenced in index.js
